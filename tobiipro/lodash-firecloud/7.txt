   I see you are having some fun :)
   What about existing _.reject comparing to filterOut?
   And your keep is the same as _.remove, but with falsy predicate?
   Never thought that you are a fan of syntax sugar :)

   Naming... Yup. No need for_.filterOut, it's the same as _.reject Maybe
   _.keep has an equivalent too? I guess i have to search the codebase,
   their namings and me don't blend apparently, proof is your _.reject
   find. PS: it's not for me but i saw this coming for enforcing immutable
   methods and we (maybe because is me not knowing about reject) use
   filter and remove as counterparts. I needed an immutable remove so that
   we don't start writing _.filter _.negate _.iteratee everywhere 🤦‍♂️
   funny that the author didn't mention it in his reply 😉. I don't have a
   drive for a mutable _.keep so i think i will close the issue. Best way
   to end a PR "Closing, functionality exists already. You just didn't
   read the docs (properly)" 😂
