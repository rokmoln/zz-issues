   Reproduced couple times on eslint-config-firecloud, I think.

   "empty git stash" as in your repo is squicky clean, you get a "stash
   which is empty", it goes forward with the release, and then fails to
   pop the last (empty) stash?

   do I read you correctly?

   Yes. I didn't see any actual fail, but then stash "WIP..." keeps
   hanging.
