   …s current form

   annoyances:
     * rebasing is manual
     * rebasing may be required extremely often even in a mildly active
       repo
     * "Update branch" button in github gui does the "wrong" (TM) thing -
       it merges master into the PR branches, rather than rebasing it
     * there's no way to automatically rebase (say once a day)
     * having this enabled across all repos is more of a "let's see errors
       everywhere and ignore them" rather than pay attention to some
       meaningful error

   PS: to be followed by manually disabling the check in our repos
