   some repositories might have a pre-push hook like
   [65]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/repo/dot.
   git/hooks/pre-push

   but in makefiles/scripts that call git push we might not want to run
   the pre-push hook.

   every call to git push should be questioned if it actually need to run
   the pre-push hook, and if not, it should use the --no-verify flag
