   In the minimal setup like
let {
  MinLog,
  logToConsole
} = require('./src/index');

let logger = new MinLog({
  listeners: [
    logToConsole({
      level: 'INFO'
    })
  ],
  serializers: []
});

logger.info('test');

   crashes with
(node:75745) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: (0 , _moment.default)(
...).utcOffset(...).toISOString is not a function

   yes, because log-to-console listener is dependent on the time
   serializer.
   I don't see it particularly bad that listeners need some serializers to
   work.

   suggestions?

   Not to use moment at all and use default Date serializer without any
   dependencies. Related to [79]#14

   that is unrelated. the "problem" is that the listener expects time to
   be formatted (serialized) i.e. expected entry._time.stamp

   changing by what it is serialized (moment or date) is irrelevant.

   I pushed [90]075e51c - because that's how I was imagining the console
   logger (but I forgot a 'true' argument when calling 'toISOString')

   Related to [91]#14, I also introduced duration-handling with trackTime.
   How do you suggest that to be solved, if we remove moment&similar and
   go back to built-in Date? A. just don't B. find a replacement for human
   durations C. ?

   Well, that's not immediately obvious at all.
