   Don't see much need in this function, tbh. But it's there and with
   tests, so don't see harm.

   probably, remove braces. _.noop() returns undefined

   need:
      maybeContinue = await _.alwaysPromise(onLargeRecordEntries(largeRecordEntr
ies));

   is equivalent to
       maybeContinue = onLargeRecordEntries(largeRecordEntries);
       if (_.isFunction((maybeContinue || {}).then)) {
         maybeContinue = await maybeContinue;
       }
