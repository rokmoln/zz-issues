   when logging in the browser, you log references, which in turns means
   that anything that is folded may not accurate when you unfold. see
   [65]https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5223513/why-doesnt-console-log-
   take-a-snapshot-of-the-passed-variables

   this is only possible in the browser, and the benefit of logging
   references versus snapshots are closer to corner cases, as in it
   happens seldom, and when you do it you do not expect that log entry to
   ever change

   a suggestion would be that minlog could be configurable to log
   snapshots instead, and MinLog::ref(variable) would be a function that
   returns a MinLog.Ref instance, that when logged would make MinLog to
   log the variable instead of the snapshot.
minlog.info(window); // log a snapshot of window, probably not performant at all
minlog.info(minlog.ref(window)); // log a reference of window, just like console
.log does

   relevant code:

   [66]minlog/src/listeners/log-to-console.js

   Line 219 in [67]24541e1
   extraArgs.push(value);
   could be changed to say extraArgs.push(value instanceOf MinLog.Ref ?
   value : JSON.parse(fastSafeStringify(value)));
