   i don't see the need for one. the other ones - a babel-preset and a
   eslint-config - have the npm-install-peer-dependencies script as a
   convenience, not as a necessity

   what should happen is to have bluebird as a prod dependency, until we
   can actually bump to nodejs 8 and remove it altogether
