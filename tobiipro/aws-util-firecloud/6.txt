   Abstract in a sense to be reused between these two? I don't think it
   should, it's just a coincidence that they have same (or just similar?)
   API and there might be more differences later.

   Nice! Sorry, it took so long to review it, but I wanted to be focused
   when doing it.

   I'm questioning now this approach where a lib function almost silently
   fails to send records. I know we have it in the firehose too, but
   still. I would say it's up to the app to decide how to deal with such
   records.

   Should we maybe just expose a helper function that checks a record size
   and allows a client to decide what to do with non-conforming records?
