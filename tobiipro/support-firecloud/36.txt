   Travis CI seems to have an ongoing unification effort for public and
   private repos

   looks good to me, it was not cool at all to have them separate. I can
   do that

   I suppose the build history is lost with moving over but I see no issue
   with that. Do you?

   Earlier I set up a new integration between GH and Travis and Travis
   were supposed to migrate .org repos to .com some time during autumn
   automatically. I guess it didn't happen (:

   should be done-done. some noise on the slack channels might follow
   saying the travis-ci.com build is now green (the builds have no
   history, so status changed from unknown to green)

   docs/etc in support-firecloud were updated in [109]9b5c5b5
