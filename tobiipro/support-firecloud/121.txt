   we've had several issues in the past few years (the most recent one
   being that npm dedupe breaks the dependency tree, and needs an extra
   npm install) and now this

   i've investigated a contender one year ago - pnpm
   [66]https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm and the only issues found then were
   around deps that were relying incorrectly on deps without specifying
   them in package.json (but work in npm because of the flattening
   side-effect of its installation algorithm) and around git deps. both of
   those issues have been fixed afaik, so it should be tested again.

   alternatively yarn is second in line, though disk space issues,
   license, etc issues were flying around, so it also needs proper
   attention.

   other serious contenders?
