   not saying that we should, but just FYI: eslint (now?) supports having
   configs in a plugin package
   [66]https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#using-the-configurat
   ion-from-a-plugin . The reverse of what we do with the peerDependencies
   trick.

   i'm mentioning this because i didn't know about this until the past
   weeks, and because one could see this as a supported "standard" vs the
   "hack" that we use today.

   I'm personally happy to keep things as they are until they stop
   working.

     If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

   closing out of lack of time/prio
