   [67]@afogelberg approached me today with katt not being able to fetch
   deps. It appeared that he didn't have erlang on his machine. Should
   this maybe be a part of bootstrap?

   Thanks for bringing this up, Ian!
   Erlang is not part of the current bootstrap because it's not a generic
   tool (i.e. gnu tools) nor is it a tool used by most of our repos. Plus
   it was taking a while to compile - but should be fast now with the
   linuxbrew setup. Saying this from the CI bootstrap's perspective.

   I think what should happen is that make deps should actually run
   Brewfile.inc.sh, if one exists in the repo. It's just that it should be
   "smart" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ and skip everything that is already part of the dev
   bootstrap.
