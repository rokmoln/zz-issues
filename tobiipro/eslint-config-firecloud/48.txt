   Collecting issues below
     * turn off @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type. At
       times, it is both easier and natural to not create a type for the
       return value. A function returning an object structure that is a
       one-time structure benefits nothing from a type getting defined
       standalone, plus it makes changes harder (if you want to add a
       field, you need to add it in two places). The solution is to
       temporarily disable the rule, which might not be the first thought
       of a developer since the rule is enabled for a reason, right?
       Turning off the rule globally though ends up hiding issues because
       in other cases the object structure actually should be defined
       standalone e.g. if used in many places.
