   Both Andreas F and I have encountered this problem. Although not a big
   problem it can be quite confusing the first time seeing it.

   So far, we have not seen any clear pattern of what is causing this.

   We had a hypothesis that it something to do with deploying a lambda
   from the terminal (vs deployed from Travis) but when tested it worked
   also for this case.
