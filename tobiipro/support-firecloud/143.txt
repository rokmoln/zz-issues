   this variable is set in
   [65]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/sh/dev.in
   c.sh#L24 in order to signal that the shell session is adequately set
   up.

   when running make in a repository set up with support-firecloud or call
   a support-firecloud script like
   [66]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/tree/master/bin , we
   could see if SF_DEV_INC_SH=true and crash early if it's not.

   this would be a quick feedback loop that major things are not set up
   adequately on the development machine and thus the execution may have
   unexpected side-effects

   PS: a solution is needed for the CI flow (where there's no
   SF_DEV_INC_SH environment variable). Solutions range
     * from just exporting SF_DEV_INC_SH=true
     * to implement the check as SF_DEV_INC_SH=true || CI=true,
     * to implement a new environment variable in repo/dot.ci.sh.sf like
       SF_CI_SH and implement the check as SF_DEV_INC_SH=true ||
       SF_CI_SH=true
