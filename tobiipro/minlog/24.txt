   FYI [49]@tobiiasl this commit is what enables typescript [50]943d057 .
   Should be pretty straightforward.

   [51]@tobiiasl where would you put (maintain and export) common types
   e.g. src/types.ts? lodash-firecloud?

   Late to the game. But it sounds like a good start to have them in
   lodash-firecloud.
