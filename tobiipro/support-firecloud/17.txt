   moved from
   [67]https://github.com/tobiipro/eslint-plugin-firecloud/issues/1 as it
   is probably a bug in npm, not with eslint-plugin-firecloud

   Reason is unknown as it does not seem deterministic (bug in npm?).
   It happened before once or twice, but i took it as a glitch in the
   matrix and restarting the build made it go green. Just like this build

   fwiw I cannot replicate locally within the lodash-firecloud repo
rm -rf ~/.npm; git clean -xdf .; npx npm@5.6.0 i # 10 times. 5.6.0 is what comes
 with the latest nodejs 9.8.0
rm -rf ~/.npm; git clean -xdf .; npx npm@5.7.1 i # 10 times. 5.7.1 is the latest
 stable, which we use

   [151]@IanSavchenko shouldn't we remove then the "upgrade pacote
   forcefully" trick?

   EDIT: I talked to soon. Travis will install the latest LTS of node,
   which may have an older pacote, which may be flimsy...
