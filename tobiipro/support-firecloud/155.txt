   [47]replace eclint with editorconfig-checker
     * Fixes: [48]#149
     * Breaking change: [ ]
     __________________________________________________________________

    1. the reasons for this change are described in [49]#149
    2. because devs will not bootstrap their machines immediately, and
       install editorconfig-checker, we still defaultl to eclint
       (installed as part of package.json)
    3. editorconfig-checker is a golang binary, without a homebrew
       formula, and without a standalone install script. Since we use
       homebrew/linuxbrew, I created a local homebrew formula that is easy
       to update via a template script, when someone wants to bump the
       version of editorconfig-checker
    4. TODO once this is merged, a new issue should be created - a
       reminder to remove support for eclint, and expect
       editorconfig-checker to be installed

   // cc [50]@fredrikj this should take care of "missing eclint" after
   running bin/repo-{generic,node}-bootstrap, since we don't mention
   eclint in the repo/package.json template

   When/how is this file run? brew something?

   You run it manually whenever you want to bump the version and generate
   a new .rb counterpart (will fetch the checksums).

   foreach is a function in support_firecloud? What's wrong with for x in
   ...?
   What is make-lazy and why didn't I find any definition of it when
   grepping for it in support_firecloud?

   This is a makefile. foreach is a make call

   make-lazy def:

   Pretty sure that grepping from the terminal (not github ui) finds it ;)
