   Why specifically debug and not something else?

     Want to send the logging fn as an arg?

   Naah. I would still leave a default value and then I would need to
   override it on every usage - not nice.

   I would choose out of two options:
    1. Rename function to debugTrackTime and set it in stone (so-so).
    2. Add a property to MinLog class like trackTimeLevelName with some
       reasonable default like debug.

   or, since it's a question of levels, I added a time level
