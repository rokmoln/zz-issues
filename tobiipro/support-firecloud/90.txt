   [59]@tobiiasl didn't you say you don't need retry anymore, because curl
   has it builtin functionality?

   I did say that. But then I discovered it did not work: I checked the
   retry options in curl but it turned out they only work with 5xx errors.
   ([62]tobiipro/gs-server#27 (comment)).

   So I still think retry is needed and is the best option.
