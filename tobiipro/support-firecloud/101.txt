   Seems like it is still needed, can be checked with > travis endpoint.
   Btw, travis CLI hasn't seen a single commit since November :(

   We currently use Travis CI and thus prefer it for consistency, but
   other CIs are ok given reasonable consideration.
   Go to https://travis-ci.com/profile/tobiipro
   A very first step to setup an integration with Travis CI is to visit
   https://github.com/organizations/tobiipro/settings/installations,
   press `Configure` next to `Travis CI` and make sure that Travis
   has access to your repo in the `Repository access` section dropdown.

   What i noticed these days is that this is automatically done with the

   ### Migrating secrets from existing repo
   To make the setup faster and avoid looking for secrets all over
   different places,
   you can _manually_ get all the secrets in existing repo. To do so,
   start a debugging session in Travis UI and after some minutes in Travis
   output log

   Maybe just link to the section describing how to start a debug build?

   I will add that, but for a one-time thing it's fine to use Web UI, no
   need to go and look for the token, read args for the cmd. Easier for
   me, at least.

   Oh yeah, definitely. I don't know how the docs look like now but I
   agree that the docs around "debug build" should prio the UI. The reason
   I changed my mind is that Travis, at least so far, just works. I guess
   I'm on the advanced usage, and I don't debug more than once a week on
   average. In the beginning I thought debugging would happen quite often,
   thus the travis-debug script... üôÑ
