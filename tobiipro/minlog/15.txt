   Repro example:
let {
  MinLog,
  logToConsole,
  serializeTime
} = require('./src/index');

let logger = new MinLog({
  listeners: [
    logToConsole({
      level: 'INFO'
    })
  ],
  serializers: [
    serializeTime
  ]
});

let A = class {
  constructor() {
    this.test = 'test';
  }
};

logger.info('test', new A());

   Receiving:
2019-03-01T15:54:36.047Z  INFO
test

   Expected: probably, MinLog should call toString of the object.
