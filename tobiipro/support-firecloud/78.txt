   Concluding some minimum exploration of CircleCI as an alternative for
   the current TravisCI. Here's some random minuses

   Caches: CircleCI caches are "immutable", and there seems to be no easy
   way to go around that i.e. to make job n restore the cache of job n-1
   of the same workflow&branch. Clearing caches is also not a feature at
   the moment, so the only thing to do is bump up a "version" marker in
   the cache name.

   UI: maybe it's a matter of getting used to it, but clicking through the
   UI just for the purpose of browsing the workflow-to-job-and-back info
   is not optimized

   Logs: no way to download raw logs from UI. I guess there's an API for
   it?! Also there is no code folding feature, so the logs could be
   sometimes hard to parse visually.

   Config: rather duplicative and hard to follow. While
   support-firecloud's config is an outlier, overusing yaml references was
   a must, and just for the purpose of having a PR flow and a nightly
   flow, they will still be needed. No support for encrypted variables,
   but not a biggie.

   Docs: I would say low-to-medium quality, a mix of info from CircleCI
   1.0 and 2.0 and 2.1. The configuration I wrote for support-firecloud is
   half baked by googling the "CircleCI Discuss" platform.

   Features/Community: it looks like there are core features that people
   see in other CI services, which are lingering to be implemented/ported
   to CircleCI, while at the same time some "features" (e.g. immutable
   caches) exist without having public support.

   Debug: SSH debugging is available, but CircleCI triggers another run of
   the job to debug, and only afterwards it prints the SSH info. Also, it
   looks like the machine is available for 2 hours, allowing for multiple
   SSH sessions (a minus for security).

   EDIT PR: one cannot have different workflows for PRs without shell
   hacks

   My 2penny: good alternative, but might be bumpy.

   PS: nice to see so few Travis specifics. I just needed to export some
   env vars, and everything worked. So porting to another CI is mainly
   equivalent to rewriting the configuration around what to run, when to
   run and cache.

   Had the same impression. Some UI workflows are somewhat broken and
   non-linear.

     Logs: no way to download raw logs from UI. I guess there's an API
     for it?! Also there is no code folding feature, so the logs could be
     sometimes hard to parse visually.

   Yes, but not stupid log size limitation.

     support-firecloud's config is an outlier, overusing yaml references
     was a must, and just for the purpose of having a PR flow and a
     nightly flow, they will still be needed. No support for encrypted
     variables, but not a biggie.

   Tried it on a smaller project and didn't see much difference with
   Travis.

   Yes, I also found the mix to be confusing. But everything seemed to be
   googlable.

   As I understand, we can also leverage our own docker images for the
   builds, which is not possible on Travis.

   AFAICS, it's not without problems in this area

   On circleci: I subscribed to [82]https://status.circleci.com
   notifications (exactly a month ago), and they are many. One could argue
   that maybe they are better, more meticulous, at monitoring than others,
   or that they monitor also side-things (like npm for instance), I don't
   know what it's the cause, but the feeling that I have is of "regular
   hiccups".

   Is it possible to see how much time to utilize Travis? In order to
   assess the cost on a pay per %time% model like Cirrus
