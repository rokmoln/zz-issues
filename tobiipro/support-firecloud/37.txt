   I made "make release" on the branch release_may_2018 in gs-client repo.
   I got the error

   fatal: 'v0.0.30' does not appear to be a git repository

   caused by the line

   $(GIT) push $(GIT_REMOTE) v$(CAT) "package.json" | $(JSON) "version"``

   GIT_REMOTE seems to not be set. It gets set by

   GIT_REMOTE = $(shell git config branch.$(GIT_BRANCH).remote
   2>/dev/null)

   Testing directly:
   ~/gs-client$ git config branch.release_may_2018.remote
   ~/gs-client$ git config branch.release_apr_2018.remote
   ~/gs-client$ git config branch.master.remote
   origin
   ~/gs-client$ git config branch.tln-master.remote
   origin

   I created the release branches this way:
   git checkout f5a16974c1adb5c0e7f6cc4ba6cfdd3c3260cae2
   git checkout -b release_may_2018

   The strange thing is that make release works fine on Srivanis computer.

   It was again the problem with that these branches were not set up to
   track origin. So this solved the problem:
   git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/release_may_2018 release_may_2018

   Now:
   ~/gs-client$ git config branch.release_may_2018.remote origin
