   to refresh dependencies to the latest matching version. I got bit by a
   bug in the jest ecosystem recently, a bug which wasn't seen on Travis,
   but "only on my computer"

   Downside: time. This adds another 10+ seconds to make deps/npm. In
   theory npm install can be replaced by npm update but I don't want to
   put my trust in npm maintaining that behaviour.

   Open for suggestions or just not doing it 🤷‍♂️

   I would say that I'm more for package.lock file, but this change is
   better than what we have now.

   [66]@IanSavchenko right, I didn't try to see what happens when a
   package-lock.json exists, but I updated the PR to skip npm update when
   it does. i also enabled npm prune on the dev env. make sense?

   PS: re package-lock.json we can test it out on the "apps" and see what
   troubles we get into 👻 (but never on the "libs" e.g. lodash-firecloud)

   Maybe we should do prune after update?

   hmm, my idea was to minimize the work for npm update.
   you're thinking that npm update would add junk?

   I just did a small test, and npm prune after update comes empty handed
   (no removals)

   so npm update already reorganizes the packages it touches, just doesn't
   remove extraneous dependencies
