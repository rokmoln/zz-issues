   This doesn't make sense to me. Second regexp is very general and makes
   the first one that you added redundant.
   I don't know what files you want to ignore but maybe it's possible to
   find some more specific regexps.

   Alternatively you can ignore path-checks for each lambda, in the
   lambda's Makefile.
