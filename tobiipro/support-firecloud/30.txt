   Summary: When I run bootstrap it complains that findutils is not
   installed with the right options:
   [ERR ] findutils is already installed with options '', [ERR ] but not
   the required '--with-default-names'. [ERR ] Consider uninstalling
   findutils with 'brew uninstall findutils' and rerun the bootstrap!

   After uninstalling findutils and running bootstrap again:
   [ERR ] gnu-sed is already installed with options '', [ERR ] but not the
   required '--with-default-names'. [ERR ] Consider uninstalling gnu-sed
   with 'brew uninstall gnu-sed' and rerun the bootstrap!

   After uninstalling gnu-sed and running bootstrap again I get the first
   error. And so it goes on.

   Full log below:

       ==> Caveats
       This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into
       /usr/local,
       because macOS provides an older sqlite3.

   If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/sqlite/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

   For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
   LDFLAGS: -L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib
   CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include

   ==> Caveats
   Once you run this version of gpg you may find it difficult to return to
   using
   a prior 1.4.x or 2.0.x. Most notably the prior versions will not
   automatically
   know about new secret keys created or imported by this version. We
   recommend
   creating a backup of your ~/.gnupg prior to first use.

   Even after I manually install findutils with the right flags I get an
   error:
   brew uninstall findutils brew install findutils --with-default-names

   Still gives the error:
