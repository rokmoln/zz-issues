   i.e. allow sameline for "named arguments" someFun({arg: true, another:
   false}) i.e. (function has 1 argument, of type object)
   but don't allow let a = {arg: true, another: false}, and instead
   require newlines

    1. Why should this be allowed for named args?
    2. When should it be forbidden for named args (if there are such
       cases)?
    3. Is there an exception for 1 param in object case?
