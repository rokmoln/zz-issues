   after [66]#51 , the first run on a travis containers (with no sudo)
   takes 30+ minutes. Thanks to aggressive caching, the following runs go
   down 10 times, to 3+ minutes.

   I wrote TravisCI a feature request that should substantially decrease
   the first-time runs, and also the cache sizes.

     Hi!

     We love the quick-to-spin no-sudo containers, yet there's a BUT :)
     We run on macos when developing, but we deploy to linux. And
     homebrew is king on macos for package management.
     Rather than finding the equivalent apt packages, or
     configure-make-etc ourselves, or finding out quirks with
     platform-dependent python2 pip2 python3 pip3 etc, we have recently
     switched our bootstrapping to [67]http://linuxbrew.sh

     You can actually see how on the first run (no cache) it is 4 times
     faster to spin up a sudo-VM and install more packages
     than it is to spin up a no-sudo-containers and install less packages
     via linuxbrew
     [68]https://travis-ci.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/builds/93344821

     It's only thanks to aggressive caching that we manage to go down to
     3-4 minutes on following runs on no-sudo-containers...

     The background of this behaviour is that
     just like homebrew builds bottles assuming that HOMEBREW_PREFIX is
     /usr/local,
     linuxbrew assumes HOMEBREW_PREFIX is /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew

     On no-sudo travis containers /home/linuxbrew is not writable, so
     linuxbrew then defaults to ~/.linuxbrew i.e. /home/travis/.linuxbrew
     but many bottles are prefix-dependent so linuxbrew cannot use those
     bottles, and instead compiles locally. Which can take forever even
     for simple packages like git, bash and make.

     So here's a feature request - allow /home/linuxbrew/to be writable
     on travis containers
     as per the linuxbrew's install script
     [69]https://github.com/Linuxbrew/install/blob/master/install#L236
     and then all bottles would be poured in a zippy.

     Thank you in advance,
     Andrei

   a reply from travis referenced a recent blog post
   [82]https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-11-19-required-linux-infrastructure
   -migration

   TL;DR remove sudo-false because containers will go away (in 3 days from
   today actually)

   PS: no idea who received this "service mail" they talk about though .
   do you [83]@alsmyr ?

     28 November, 2018 - We will send a service email to remind folks
     still using sudo: false on recent builds to remind you to migrate.

   either.
