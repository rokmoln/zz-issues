   Further actions must be done by another team members.
     * [X] Remove from the [64]list of Auth0 admins.
     * [X] Remove on [65]DataDog. Probably, only [66]@alsmyr can do this.
     * [X] When awsatex-devprod infra stack is deployed, remove user in
       [67]AWS console in atexdev account.
     * [X] [DEL: Remove from repos with transcrypt and updated transcrypt
       passwords. :DEL]
       EDIT: Too extreme. Cutting off access to the repos is good enough.
       Changing all passwords every single time a team member leaves is
       unsustainable. And deleting the encrypted password in each repo
       will happen in time. /Andrei
     * [X] [DEL: Update all secrets in the secrets repo. :DEL]
       EDIT: Too extreme. Cutting off access to the repos is good enough.
       Changing all passwords every single time a team member leaves is
       unsustainable. /Andrei
