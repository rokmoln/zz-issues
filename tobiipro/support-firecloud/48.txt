   new and not used, but i wanted to have it on par with the target for
   pipenv
   might get removed by the time I'm done (I didn't request a review yet üòù
   just wanted to have the diffs in front of me)

   Maybe --production? [62]https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install

   such incomplete docs :) but yes, I would have made the change myself
   since it's stupid to go with the "shorter" long-option

   ps: such bad design to allow for stuff like -v or --ver or --vsn or
   --version, same for npm i, same for ...ranting...ranting...ranting :)
   btw, I don't think --save-production works, or at least it didn't work
   at some point üôÑ

   why do we include py.check.flake.mk in py.common.mk? In JS check.*
   targets are not included.
