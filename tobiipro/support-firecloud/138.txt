[62]@andreineculau [63]andreineculau commented [64]Jan 22, 2020

     * make support-firecloud/update should update to the latest tag
     * deploy docker images only on tag

   why?
     * commits to master might be broken
     * you might not want to update docker images on every commit to
       master branch for reliability purposes
