    1. If you start a task in travis_wait, all the output will be output
       to a file. By logic in our CI script, later this file we will
       append, but see p.3
    2. travis_wait will periodically tail some of the lines from output
       file which can randomly be travis_fold sometimes
    3. Some other logs slip through file, because they are sent to error
       stream. This creates mess.

   Nice find!

   Random hint: monkey-patch the checked-in bin/travis-wait script to
   replace travis-fold markers. I was about to write that i have no
   helpers, but coffee kicked in üòÇ
