   Sorry, but I don't really agree with this. Of course, there should not
   be long comments on the same line (I'm guessing, you saw it in code by
   me :D), but sometimes a short comment on the same line is exactly what
   is needed. Like it was in configs/firecloud.js, before this change,
   where you have a list of options and now in the middle of them you have
   a comment and it's not really obvious which option this comment belongs
   to, so it would be better to pad it with empty lines like
 OnlyParam: {
        multiline: true,

        // 0 aka disable
        minProperties: 0,

        consistent: true
      },
},

   And then the number of lines has grown by +3.

   If you want it really bad, we can turn it on as a warning.
