   I see that in the bin/repo-generic-bootstrap a symlink will be created
   for Brewfile.inc.sh. So it means that
    1. If you don't have anything custom: stay with symlinked version of
       Brewfile.inc.sh. Ok.
    2. If you have a custom brew setup, replace the symlink with a copy of
       it and modify it. Right? If yes, then I would prefer not having
       symlinked Brewfile.inc.sh in repos, thus not having it mandatory.
       Why? Because when I sometimes see symlinked files from SF I don't
       really know if it is ok to "unsymlink" them and if it is expected
       of me to do that. Because you (next person changing source in SF)
       may assume that I won't do that and can make a breaking change.

   Just to clarify:
    0. When I see symlink on SF, I don't know if I can remove it safely or
       not, because I don't know if the author (in 99% cases you,
       [63]@andreineculau) wants to keep it as a symlink and update just
       the source in SF. That's a bit dangerous dependency pattern, I
       believe.
    1. I think it's ok to have symlinks from SF for things that we: a)
       know they have to be in a certain location; b) know that they don't
       change from repo to repo. Good example: ./transcrypt or ./.npmrc.
    2. For all other boilerplate files, I think we should just create a
       copy. For example, I think we should change this for .vscode
       folder, where should start from some common template, but then be
       able to modify it in every repo according to the needs.

   So my suggestion: change the symlink to a copy in bootstrap. Then I
   would feel safer changing it and I think it will be ok to make it
   mandatory.

   that is indeed the driver for choosing symlink over copy

   with regards to "safety", everything is "safe". there's no reason why
   anyone should doubt the possibility of un-symlinking and changing the
   contents (at the expense of not benefiting from changes upstream i.e.
   changes that come with the support-firecloud submodule)

   symlinking is merely a way to reduce manual work when smth changes.
   example "changing the vanilla .editorconfig" becomes simpler when it
   gets updated via upgrading support-firecloud alone (like when fixing a
   bug with support-firecloud and wanting to bring that fix into the
   bootstrapped repo), vs one day editing smth, ending up in a PR, and
   then looking "why the heck didn't eclint complain because we enforced X
   one year ago?"

   would it make you feel safer if repo-*-bootstrap would clarify the
   intention via a followup message after printing Symlinked X.?

     For all other boilerplate files, I think we should just create a
     copy. For example, I think we should change this for .vscode folder,
     where should start from some common template, but then be able to
     modify it in every repo according to the needs.

   the problem with the driver is that it's not only subjective but that
   we also have very few datapoints to decide on (both in terms of human
   resources = users, and cases = repos). for instance, .vscode (folder)
   could have stayed a symlink many years just fine if it wasn't for you
   having a usecase where you want to add launch.json so we when with
   symlinks for files within .vscode instead. the rest of the .vscode
   files are still happily symlinks, although there's nothing to say that
   in time it won't change. but now, if there's smth new in VSCode and we
   really want to bring that setting into all repos, it's simpler with
   symlinks.

   on-topic: Brewfile.inc.sh should have never been a symlinked artifact
   in repo-generic-bootstrap. I myself copied the file in all our repos,
   so I can only say thanks for spotting it!

   Thanks for the clarification!

   Probably, yes. But now I know where to look. Will the next team members
   know that? :)
