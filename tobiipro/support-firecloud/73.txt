   Intended flow
     * make promote/prod/v0.0.100
     * get presented with the 'git log' (simple, oneline per commit) of
       changes to be promoted from v0.0.99 to v0.0.100
     * get asked if the user wants to continue
     * do the promoting via travis, if the user didn't say cancel at the
       previous question
