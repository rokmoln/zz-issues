   with this change, a project using angular-cli that wants tslint@~5.11.0
   but uses tslint-config-firecloud which wants tslint@^5.16.0 will be
   able to run a successful make deps-npm while catching (failing) other
   unmet peer deps

   marked as bugfix since the current situation of allowing any unmet peer
   deps is undesirable
