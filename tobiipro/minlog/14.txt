   Is it really "Min" after that?

   yes, interface-wise (minlog does has a super simple flow with no
   surprises, no convenience gimmicks, that allow for any conceivable
   setup)
   and probably relative-wise as well - e.g. bunyan has dtrace for
   instance, many have terminal color handling, etc

   ps: tangentially related
   [74]https://github.com/tobiipro/minlog/tree/f/anu-dayjs and I don't
   think timezone handling is vital. And then we're left with
   lodash-firecloud which will stay
