   Regarding linter comments:
    1. In the places where you are disabling jest/prefer-strict-equal
       couldn't you use toMatch and toMatchObject?
    2. Had this question before: why do we have the rule
       jest/no-test-callback? What's wrong with that? I read the rule
       description, which says that people forget to call done in
       scenarios when test fails. But if that happens test will fail
       anyway with timeout. Otherwise, I see no harm using done when you
       are testing callback-based APIs and don't want to convert to
       promises (like you have here)

    1. good that you ask, because i was going to ask you if we should turn
       the rule off. i didn't know about toMatchObject but reading the
       docs [67]https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect.html#tomatchobjectobject
       it's not equivalent. because toEqual will fail if you have more
       props than what you expect, or so i think. i think we should have
       it off in the preset, at least based on the experience these days,
       since you cannot use toBe for non-primitives most of the times
    2. i took it as "we prefer async-await pattern vs callback" on top of
       what the rule description says. with async taking over cb, i think
       it makes sense to keep it. wdys?

    1. I also didn't know about toEqual gotcha with extra keys not
       considered a difference. I thought that it was your intention to
       use this and have matching behavior instead of strict equality and
       you didn't know about toMatchObject. This rule makes some sense, so
       I would probably keep it. But I don't understand why you had to
       disable it in these cases? Because there were keys with undefined
       values in resulting objects?
    2. Ok, let's keep it.

     I also didn't know about toEqual gotcha with extra keys not
     considered a difference.

   just for clarity:
     * toEqual: exact deep structure
     * toMatchObject: subset deep structure

   It's toMatchObject that will not fail on extra keys.

   the rest,... I'm <insert not so nice word>... I didn't know about
   toStrictEqual. I guess I didn't read the rule description, because I
   thought it's telling me to use toBe thus my previous comment:

     since you cannot use toBe for non-primitives most of the times
