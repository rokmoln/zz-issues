   what this is missing is the ability to publish to testers

   but we're not going to be adding more functionality and maintain this.
   we anyway decided that we actually want to keep the current behaviour
   of doing manual publishing - higher control with low risk of errors

   if at somepoint we want to do automate this, we can reopen this or we
   could probably use smth like
