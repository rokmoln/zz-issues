   installing packages in travis containers is only possible via
   travis.yml and is limited to a whitelist, or else compile and make
   locally.

   I have asked them if there is some undocumented way of installing
   packages on containers, so that we can still have a list of necessary
   stuff in a script (great for reuse), but the answer was negative

     Our addon to install packages runs as a Ruby function that iterates
     on the selected packages (see the lines here, if you're curious) and
     in this case we don't use a predefined bash function as we do in
     other cases - such as, when installing the Artifacts addon, to put
     an example.
     Even if this bash function existed, running it would require having
     sudo privileges, which are deactivated before the job starts the
     stages where it runs the user commands from the configuration.

   thus, maybe give [65]http://linuxbrew.sh a try. potentially the
   bootstrap scripts are 99% the same for linux with no sudo rights
   (travis container), linux with sudo rights and darwin
