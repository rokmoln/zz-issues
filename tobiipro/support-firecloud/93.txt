   I had a look at the codebase and also at the reported issues
   [80]https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint/issues?q=is%3
   Aissue+is%3Aclosed .

   Unfortunately I have to close this as wontfix. I will not put in the
   effort for this because I think it will simply annoy people: false
   positives, bugs, get stuck, etc

   Just as a knowledge-note: I believe the first step in the right
   direction would be for AWS to spit out official JSON Schemas. That
   could take care of 80% of the checking. Assuming that they don't use
   some sort of schema on the cloudformation backend, they could also
   start using JSON Schema there. Once that is done, only then introduce
   business-logic checks in a public validation tool to mimic the
   requirements and/or backend's realities. As it is right now,
   [81]https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint is more of a
   poor man's linter with an official stamp.
   [82]https://github.com/fungusakafungus/cloudformation-jsonschema is a
   thousand times more nobel effort.
