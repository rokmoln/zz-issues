   Off-topic: first github.com/tobiipro review request ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽˆ ðŸ’¬ ðŸ¤—

   General question: is this module supposed to be a valid easy-to-use (or
   semi-easy-to-use) NPM package as a result? Or it's just an open-sourced
   part of atex?

   [52]@IanSavchenko I don't follow entirely, but it's definitely not the
   latter :) (the latter just cannot be :D )

   alright, I have checked all the checkboxes that I created, so now it's
   100% up to your feedback to do more/change [55]@IanSavchenko

   [58]README.md
   ((87 lines not shown))
   `actualDevicePixelRatio * displayZoom * pageZoom`.
   ## Page zoom
   One of them is the page zoom that the user sets via the browser.
   It is close to impossible to get the page zoom from within the web
   page,
   but [priv/guess-zoom.js](priv/guess-zoom.js) is a proof of concept to
   guess it.
   The only way to get the real value is via a WebExtension
   and the
   [tabs.getZoom()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensi
   ons/API/tabs/getZoom) API.
   If you are on OSX, that might be enough, but if you're on Windows, read
   on.
   ## Display zoom and actual device pixel ratio

   Can mention here that "Display zoom" is what is in code
   "screen.osZoomFactor"

   A bit messy now, but we can have another iteration after integrating it
   back into main code.

   Also would be good to mention in README that main purpose of the module
   is to know coordinates of browser window and client area in device
   pixels.
