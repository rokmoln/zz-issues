   NOTE: I ran the performance checks again, and the numbers seem much
   better than before. We could try using no throttling and see the

   Would be great if we can avoid throttling!

   But I don't understand why it can't be done simpler? Check in throttle
   if cfg.throttle is 0 or undefined and return function as it is.
   Otherwise, wrap it into throttle. 3 extra lines and that's all or am I
   missing something?

   It took me half an hour to understand what is going on here and another
   half an hour to test it and find couple bugs. Don't know how much time
   it took you to rename all the usages...

   The answer to your question is a question: when? when should throttle
   check? because as it is now (pre-PR) throttle is called whenever the
   module is parsed (i.e. today the cfg.throttle is "broken", or to be
   politically correct can only be changed in code, not at runtime).

   Couple things:
    1. There is no function _.deeply
    2. fn is invoked for array of values, not a single plain object value.

   Something like this works for me:
let deeply = function(fn) {
  return function(obj, iteratee) {
    return _.mapValues(obj, function(v, _name) {
      return _.isPlainObject(v) ? deeply(fn)(v, iteratee) : fn(v, iteratee);
    });
  };
};

   Generally, I support this initiative, but this solution looks to me as
   too complicated and error-prone.

   Fixed deeply and updated the PR. Thanks for the input! FWIW I didn't
   test it when I opened the PR :) I wanted to discuss it on the next
   working day, which never happened...

   TBD we test without any throttling, and if all is still fine, we just
   remove the throttling altogether in an updated version of this PR
