   Some documentation of recent bootstrapping of a new developer.

   Was suggested I put the documentation here, see comment below:

   # Bootstrapping a new developer's Macbook
   # Ensure you have admin rights

   This section belongs in
   [53]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/doc/boots
   trap.md#system

   You should also mention how you can check if you have admin=sudo rights
   e.g. by running sudo -v in the terminal, but since this is a command
   that can be automated, it can just go in the dev/X/bootstrap scripts
   and print a nice error message when the user doesn't have sudo rights.
   And then there is less to read (contacting IT should be part of the
   error as a possible resolution).

   Running sudo -v would prompt a password, right? Wouldn't that affect
   the remaining shell session and how all the remaining bootstrapping is
   installed? Or does that only occur when prefixing each install command
   with sudo i.e. sudo brew install ....?

   I'm don't have a lot of bash experience here, so correct me if I'm
   wrong, but I've heard it said before that needlessly installing thing
   with sudo would come to haunt you down the line. So when you're
   installing other things later which might depend on your previous
   installs that are now sudo installed, these new will also need sudo

   Great that you ask 😉 but no, it doesn't elevate the permissions for the
   rest of the commands. What it does is that it asks for the password
   upfront, and then the following sudo foo commands will not get stuck
   asking for the password, given that the commands run within a certain
   time period as the manpage says. That's the only read change.

   From man sudo:
       -v, --validate
                   Update the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user
                   if necessary.  For the sudoers plugin, this extends the sudo
                   timeout for another 5 minutes by default, but does not run a
                   command.  Not all security policies support cached
                   credentials.

   PS: this is a great way of doing an autopsy on a computer, because you
   can immediately type sudo -v and then ask the owner to type in his
   password (if they trust you :) ). From there on, if needed, you can run
   sudo commands without running around after the owner, or even worse
   calling them and asking for them to tell you the password 🤦‍♂️

   This is not really needed. The preferred way (for us) is to clone via
   SSH, not HTTPS although I see github changed their recommendation and
   chose HTTPS (I wonder if it's for higher acceptance among non-tech
   users)
   [64]https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/ .

   Anyway, we use SSH, meaning we reference the SSH url in submodules and
   in READMEs. So even if you start with tokens and HTTPS, you also need
   to set up your SSH key... double the work, no advantage.

   How-to regarding the github SSH key could go in a new section in
   [65]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/doc/boots
   trap.md, above the git one.

   You are free to mention the internal git server git.tobii.intra , but
   there's a fine line that can be crossed with more info than that - we
   have the support-firecloud repo as public, with the mindset that we
   have github as our development environment, while the internal git
   server is deprecated and used in exceptional cases only. So while you
   had to it (as you're working with repos not yet moved to github), it
   should be a temporary situation, and simply mentioning the git server
   without how to setup the SSH key for git.tobii.intra is a bit redundant
   - you will still need to ask someone for more info.

   In short, new github section for setting up SSH and anything else
   regarding to github in the bootstrap.md file, and no mention of
   git.tobii.intra is my feedback.

   maybe you can clarify instead in
   [70]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/README.md
   what the development section is meant for (it is meant just for that -
   to get you going for local development :) ) and then
     * mark AWS-CLI as optional
     * move "working with a local npm dependency" into the work section
     * add a link to
       [71]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/doc/b
       ootstrap-gpg.md in the development section, even if it exists in
       the work section. Bootstrapping gpg is optional btw, depends on
       what you do in a repo with secrets, and obviously if it has any
       secrets at all. So your experience of needing it is purely
       contextual - others will not need to do it.

   Not everything in the repo is required to get a machine going for local
   development. Some are more informational for when new repositories &
   projects are created.
   What I was required to do in order to start developing on an existing
   project was:
   - Every step in
   [bootstrap](https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/d
   oc/bootstrap.md)
   - Depending on your editor [bootstrap your
   editor](https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/doc/b

   anything beyond this line is redundant and should not be in
   support-firecloud.
     * working remotely - not part of development, but part of the work
       environment (documented in confluence).
     * nvm - not needed, the situations to use a specific node version
       (i.e. downgrading to one, since we try to run latest and greatest
       usually) are rare, and in those situations we should be fine with
       doing the switch via homebrew
     * rvm - also not needed, we don't even have a ruby dependency afaik

   It's commendable that you know about nvm and rvm, but similarly there
   are a gazillions of tips (setting up the command line prompt with bash
   execution codes and git status comes to mind) that are not essential to
   development. People still need to know how to search online, talk to
   others, observe what others do differently and get inspiration etc. We
   cannot and we should not cover all of that through a wall of text and
   needing to maintain it.

   Right sorry, I was thinking about how to make error prints in the
   bootstrap file if the sudo -v fails, aaand then I got distracted and
   the PR slipped my mind for a couple weeks! 😨

   I'll look into the sudo -v thing later today (having intro days atm),
   but as far as I remember I fixed all the other points you made at least

   two things though:
    1. travis failed the PR as you see, and it's because of improper
       indentation (2 instead of 4 spaces in shell scripts). But this
       would mean that maybe you edited this in an editor that was not
       bootstrapped to support editorconfig --- see
       [95]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/doc/b
       ootstrap-your-editor.md
    2. basically all branches (with some exceptions like master, etc)
       should start with f/ --- see
       [96]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/doc/w
       orking-with-git.md#feature-branches . Otherwise this PR actually
       ran travis twice (one time for the new branch, and one time for the
       PR) and since the branch-based run failed, it also spammed the ci
       slack channels

   Once you fix the indentation, and Travis says 💚 , it's a go from me and
   you can merge the pull request yourself 😉

   On it 👍

   That is odd, I have gone through the editor bootstrapping and have
   vscode setup to use editorconfig files, it does format in other
   files/repos, but I can see that it isn't enforcing the indentation rule
   to these files even when i inject a bunch of indentations 🤷‍♂️

   Is this something we do specifically for this repository or is it more

   all repos basically. see gs-client for example

   PS: line lengths left to fix. in all our repos, you should be able to
   do make; make check and you'll get the same complaints as on travis 😉

   can you rebase your branch on top of origin/master first? or maybe even
   squash/fix the commits?
   at least commits like "Merge branch 'master' into
   TFC-3061--documenting-new-developer-bootstrap" should not be in PRs,
   and they should not be in your regular workflow either
