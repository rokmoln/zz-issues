   I made a change in [65]53e1cbf
   but it's optional now, and I'm thinking it's simpler to always require
   a Brewfile.inc.sh
     * which can reference specific bootstraps e.g. source
       ${SUPPORT_FIRECLOUD_DIR}/ci/brew-install-aws.inc.sh
     * or convenience bootstraps e.g. source
       ${SUPPORT_FIRECLOUD_DIR}/ci/brew-install-common.inc.sh
     * or just install specific brew packages e.g. brew_install tensorflow

   I see it as a small breaking change FTW
   wdyt [66]@IanSavchenko ?

   I don't think I'm following it here completely, so let's take it in the
   office.

   We take it in the office, but just some numbers and context before then

   Most repos were running on travis in containers (sudo: false) and
   because of limited permissions I only bothered with installing latest
   versions of bash, make and jq, basically saying: if you want a fast
   travis run (in constainers), then you're limited in what you have
   available.

   Now, with removing sudo:false (Travis will run everything in VMs; no
   containers), everything went on the full-bootstrap flow of installing
   so much more than just bash, make and jq, thus taking many minutes
   before doing something simple and fast like "npm install, babelify,
   lint and run jest".

   Having a Brewfile.inc.sh in the root of the repo makes it possible to
   dictate what you actually need for this repo, rather than install
   everything that we find as a good solid baseline.

   In [81]tobiipro/lodash-firecloud#8 switching from the default
   ci/brew-install-common.inc.sh [82]which runs if there is no
   Brewfile.inc.sh to just ci/brew-install-minimal.inc.sh (minimal is
   actually the equivalent of what we were installing in previous
   container mode, just bash, make and jq) via Brewfile.inc.sh will cut
   the build time by around 400 seconds.

   What I'm suggesting is to remove the fallback to
   ci/brew-install-common.inc.sh in support-firecloud, thus requiring a
   Brewfile.inc.sh file in each repo.
