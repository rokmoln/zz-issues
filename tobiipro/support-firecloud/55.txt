   npm audit --json or npm audit --parseable actually

   don't know if I feel brave enough to run npm audit --fix though, but it
   might be necessary

   What happens if we make CI fail on audit failures and then we have to
   manually --fix?

   it's complicated :) that's what i wrote "it might be necessary"

   because it's not just an audit over top-level dependencies, but
   everything, so it can very well be that there's a
   sub-sub-sub-dependency that we cannot "fix" (via a new commit), and
   instead we might just call npm audit --fix which will replace the
   sub-sub-sub-dependency wherever it may hide in the dependency tree

   I see. It a nice piece of functionality but can be hard to put into
   use.

   I got a hard question from a customer about a month ago:

     how to you do vendor assessment on 3rd party dependencies?

   It has some implications on npm strategy

   closing this in the light of [132]#121 but also articles like
   [133]https://www.nearform.com/blog/comparing-npm-audit-with-snyk/

   recommendation: use specific services that do one thing well
