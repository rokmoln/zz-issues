   npm ci is very buggy, and same is npm install # with a
   package-lock.json

   it should be fairly easy™️ to
     * snapshot a node_modules folder as a zip of only package.json files
       maintaining the folder hierarchy
     * restore node_modules folder based on the zip above + downloading
       the tarballs from the npm registry and unpacking

   NOTE: this doesn't take handle postinstall scripts
