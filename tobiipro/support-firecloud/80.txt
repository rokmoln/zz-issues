   The goal is to be able to release prerelease versions by typing make
   release/pre # type alpha/beta/rc, but I have also restricted the
   version/release levels from "anything" to known ones
   "patch/minor/major", and now also "pre".

   Not sure that we need this, but ok.
   You don't want to include also premajor, preminor and prepatch to be
   fully compliant with npm version?

   Good that you question this!
   I didn't want to support prerelease per se, and I didn't notice the
   quirky behavior (if current version has not -xxx.0 suffix, then
   prerelease will bump patch version and add the suffix). I primarily
   wanted to have a consistent way to release specific versions, no matter
   if they are "pre releases", or just custom releases.

   Changed the mechanism so that we can do make release/v* e.g. make
   release/v1.2.3-rc.0 or make release/v1.2.3-ian. That was the goal.
   (Long term goal not to support installing from a git hash, and remove
   these lines
