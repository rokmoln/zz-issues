   Adding a function that can help with executing templates
   which require credentials in other accounts e.g. env-route stacks

   The function will take the essential AWS env vars and store them in
   namespaced (prefixed) env vars.

   Nice! But is it too hard to have it in one script with a variable
   number of args? I mean that when you call aws-iam-login atexdev_ops
   that just puts credentials without namespace, but if you type
   aws-iam-login atexdev_ops DEV it will namespace them?

   I see the purpose being entirely different for the two funs, plus I
   didn't want to touch a core function that "just works" TM

   optimizations to the code can always be done later i.e. have
   aws-iam-login-ns as a wrapper fun
