   I can guess what it does, but you gonna need to explain to me how it
   actually works 😄

   here goes some "bashsplaining" 😂

   if you simplify the command : cat <<< "$(foo < bar)" > bar, you have
     * > bar - write stdout to file
     * < bar - read stdin from file
     * cat - is cat
     * <<< "" - is a oneline heredoc into stdin

   in plain english:
     * output to stdout (via cat) the contents of the heredoc, and the
       heredoc is actually a command, and then into bar
     * the key is the heredoc, because it doesn't stream, thus you buffer
       the command output, and only after you process the entire
       package.json, you start writing back to package.json

   actually json has an in-place flag. jq has a beard and knows better.
   went for the less cryptic in-place version
