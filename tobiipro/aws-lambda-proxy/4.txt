   [66]https://github.com/tobiipro/aws-lambda-proxy/blob/master/src/handle
   rs/local.js#L22 and
   [67]https://github.com/tobiipro/aws-util-firecloud/blob/master/src/lamb
   da/env-ctx.js#L127 makes it impossible to override lambda's env vars
   e.g. LOG_LEVEL

   for the time being, I reckon that it is by design (lambda's env vars
   should not be overridden; otherwise the logic becomes even more
   complicated and error prone).
   if it's not by design, we might want to allow this
