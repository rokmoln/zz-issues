     * Fixes: [46]#96
     * Breaking change: [ ]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Two things changed:
    1. Do not track changes on .vscode/settings.json by adding it to
       .gitignore_global. Reason: people (me) want to do local
       customizations of settings per repo that should not be committed
       and should not be even visible to git.

   Problems:
   a) on the repo init need to commit the .vscode/settings.json forcefully
   (and every time you want to push any changes).
   b) make nuke will reset local changes. So probably, need to add some
   kind of exception.
    2. On the repo init, copy .vscode boilerplate files, instead of
       symlinking them.
       I believe it will be better in the long run, because it will remove
       a barrier for their modification ("Oh, I'm changing
       support-firecloud! Does my change really apply for everyone?").

   Right now we have there:
     * .editorconfig - probably, won't change ever.
     * extensions.json - has only extensions recommendations, which are
       actually useful and would be good to be updated on per-repo basis
     * settings.json - should be repo specific too, even not tracked, see
       more above
     * tasks.json - also, usually specific for each repo. I would like to
       leverage more of them, especially to launch debugger faster.

   Ofc, as we discussed this many times, symlinks can be unsymlinked any
   time, but again - it's a barrier.
   Another argument for this change: these files were not changed in SF
   for a year or more, so it means that they are pretty stable. And when
   we make the changing process easier, maybe, we will start using more
   customizations to those files and find new cool stuff to be included in
   the boilerplate.
