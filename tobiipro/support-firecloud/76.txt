   [47]@IanSavchenko and I sat down and came up with a short list of
   guidelines for PRs (for authors and reviewers alike), and I expanded on
   it.

   Fishing for feedback ðŸŽ£

   [DEL: PS: from a hands-on POV, support-firecloud could have a
   pull-request template
   [48]https://blog.github.com/2016-02-17-issue-and-pull-request-templates
   / which would then be symlinked and used across all our repos. Not part
   of this PR, but do say if you would like us to have one (smth simple,
   maybe just listing the guidelines, and linking to this doc section for
   further reading, as a reminder every time we open a PR) :DEL] Pull
