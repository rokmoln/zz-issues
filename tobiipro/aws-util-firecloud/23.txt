   apparently proper stack traces only come in node 12, and under a flag
   (at least that's the current state)

   maybe the babel-config-firecloud should go back to transforming
   (generators or bluebird) at least for node :(

   node 12 has async stack traces without the flag

   NOTE: we need to switch aws lambda to nodejs12 layer, if we want to ---
