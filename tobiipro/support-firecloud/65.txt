   I guess at least the first part in the "Semantic Versioning" should
   stay, even if the rest doesn't get merged in.

   PS: we could have convenience targets instead, and NOT mess up with
   changing the levels e.g.
     * make release/bugfix would always do make release/patch
     * make release/feat would do patch or minor, depending on pre/public
     * make release/break would do minor or major, depending on pre/public

   See https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html .
   **TL;DR** :
   * pre-public versions
   * `0.0.1` initial version
   * `0.0.2` minor version with **bugfixes, new features**
   * `0.1.0` major version with bugfixes, new features, **breaking
   changes**
   * public versions
   * `1.0.0` initial public version
   * `1.0.1` patch version with **bugfixes**
   * `1.1.0` minor version with bugfixes, **new features**
   * `2.0.0` major version with bugfixes, new features, **breaking
   changes**
   **You don't need to remember all of these if you use the `make
   release/*` targets below.**

   Well, if you don't then you have TL;DR table above :) Just had a crazy
   thought √° la Erik: you could just get prompts about the release. Who
   the hell cares about semver anyway $ make release git log --oneline
   <last tag>..HEAD Did you introduce breaking changes? yn Did you
   introduce new features? yn Given this is a pre/public version, the
   <level> version will be bumped

   so not only replying by email these doesn't collapse the original
   content, but I hit reply, and it added a comment to the issue, not to
   your review comment... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

   Looks impressive! What I think:
    1. We should definitely leave the docs update, super helpful!
    2. New targets look pretty complicated.

   Here we have two options:
    1. Remove them. Pros and cons:
          + Less code
          + Less bugs
          + Requires more understanding of the process (but we have docs
            now!)
          + Possible human mistakes
    2. Go with the suggestion with "convenience targets". I kind of like
       it, makes it abstract from semver and unified across the repos. I
       would only suggest having a way to verify that a version you will
       get is what you expect. Something like prompt 0.5.2 => 0.6.0.
       Proceed? or 0.5.2 => 0.6.0. Proceeding in 10 seconds. Press Ctrl+C
       to cancel.

   i vote for option 2. i will see what options we have to dryrun a
   version bump so that we present the outcome. nice with the timeout
   idea!
