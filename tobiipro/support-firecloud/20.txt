   [67]@IanSavchenko there's one negative side-effect: running make all
   test now runs check twice.

   Before the 2nd one would have been swallowed due to make's dependency
   graph.

   Possible ways to go forward:
     * leave as is, runs twice in one situation
     * find a make trick to swallow the 2nd run
     * revert
     * don't run check as part of test
     * ?

   Let's quickly discuss in the office. All the options are more or less
   acceptable.

   Keeping it simple: no dependency on check for build and test targets.
