   Quite annoying rule, considering how we like to wrap top-level
   functions with throttle or bootstrap (in case of atex-platform). I
   don't think the situation is that bad that we abuse breaking the rule
   sometimes for a better readability.

   I was also thinking about this rule :)
   But you're not thinking of having a private or _prefixed exported fun
   that is non-throttled ?
export let _fun = function() {...};

export let fun = _.throttle(_fun, ...);

   That's an option, but we plan to stop marking _private with export
   keyword. So then throttled version declaration will be separated
   somewhere at the bottom of the file. Not that it's impossible, but
   that's a considerable refactoring :)
   I'm ok with either solution of keeping the rule or not, but if we keep
   it, then it's good to agree on a new style. Just to mention, I would
   like to avoid "cabbages" like export let func =
   _.throttle(bootstrap(function { ...}));
