   Feels like Christmas is coming! Can we have our advent calendar of
   disabled linter rules? 😆
   I want no-plusplus and operator-assignment 🙏

   there is also better/no-whiles down there. Should it stay?

   I also see that only rule that stays from better plugin is
   better/no-nulls. Unfortunately, can't see anything like that in the
   main ESLint ruleset.

   nice one 👏

   there's a plugin just for that no-null with rule no-null/no-null, so
   I'm removing "better". The only annoyance in removing it is that it
   "has" to be removed manually from all the repos with a "package.json"
   that references "eslint-plugin-firecloud"

   the good thing is that those rules have a fixer 😄
