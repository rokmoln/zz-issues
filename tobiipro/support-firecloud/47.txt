   cloudfront and api-gateway (edge-optimized) require certificates to be
   placed in n.virginia

   but other scenarios (e.g. api-gateway regional) require regional
   certificates e.g. an api-gateway in ireland will only be able to use
   certificates from the ireland certificate manager

   in order to skip a few manual hops, a utility could read the necessary
   details, request the SSL certificates (and if DNS is the validation
   method, it can print out the required DNS entries)

   another util could read the output from the first util, and make the
   necessary dns changes. Two utils are needed, not just from the
   perspective of the KISS principle, but also because requesting SSL
   certificates may happen in a different account than the one that
   manages the DNS
