   i.e. check if PR commit is fast-forward from PR destination branch

   part of a travis run (maybe in after_script phase), check if PR
   (feature) branch is rebased on current destination branch (e.g. master)

   if not, fail the build.

   easy to implement, and fairly big benefit to make sure merging PRs
   works on a pretty recent master commit (it can be that the PR becomes
   outdated though i.e. last push on PR branch is 1 month ago, and
   meanwhile there are new commits on master branch -> PR shows green,
   ready to merge, but the committer still needs to make a manual decision
   to merge or not given that the new commits might actually make the PR
   red after rebasing)

   alternatives:
     * curl github api and request-changes in a review via
       [75]https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/reviews/#create-a-pull-re
       quest-review --- not possible because the github api token is not
       available in a PR travis run
     * implement a github hook (the easiest deployment for this might be
       via [76]https://zeit.co/now)
     * implement a github action (unsure about it)
