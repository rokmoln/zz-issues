   I tried to keep this PR as focused to converting from jsdoc to
   typescript as possible.

   I believe there are only a few problem areas to focus on:
     * limitInParallel and memoizeTtl have @ts-ignore for the return
       values, which I don't know how to address
     * callbackify and promisify do not carry type information of the
       original function because it would require too much typing to catch
       patterns like (...args, cb) => any (currently typescript has no way
       of doing that and utility types from ts-toolbelt are too complex
       and typescript bails out because of the complexity). As far as I
       understand though, because we use unknown, this forces the caller
       to type the result before using it.

   Can't really say I understand everything. Complex stuff going.
   Impressive. So I just commented on some random stuff that caught my
   eye.

   Is this eslint-disable needed? Afaics you specify a return type.

   I think line 59-73 can be simplified to:
      try {
        return await origFn(...args);
      } finally {
        activeCount = activeCount - 1;
      }

   Or?

   Just a thought: If I have function foo that returns a promise and I
   wrap it using limitInParallel the behavior in case of a rejected
   promise will change.

   If the promise returned by foo rejects, blabla() will get called in
   this case:
foo().catch(blabla());

   But not in this case:
limitInParallel(foo)().catch(blabla());

   Makes sense?
