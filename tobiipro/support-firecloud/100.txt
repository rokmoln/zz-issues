   Very good docs, [64]@andreineculau! Make me want to contribute :)

   I will submit a PR with updates later on, here are the issues I found.
   Please, review and let me know if my assumptions are correct, so I will
   proceed with PR.
    1. The very first step to setup integration should be to go to
       [65]https://github.com/organizations/tobiipro/settings/installation
       s, press Configure on Travis CI and give it access to the new repo
       in Repository access dropdown.
    2. enable Build only if .travis.yml is present does not seem to be
       there anymore, so can be removed, I guess.
    3. Do we need to add TRANSCRYPT_PASSWORD as Travis-encrypted variable
       or use Travis web-UI? In the current docs, it says the first one,
       but apparently, it's not a requirement anymore.
    4. Clarify the deploy section. Apparently, one has to do travis
       encrypt "<GH_TOKEN>" and it to deploy -> api_key. Or no?
    5. (ADDED) Migrate env vars
    6. (ADDED) Replace default SSH key

    1. üëç
    2. üëç
    3. webui, the "requirement" has shifted to having only webui vars
       (both easier process and more convenient for changes)
    4. deploy: if you can copy the deploy section from another repo, then
       yes travis encrypt "<GH_TOKEN>" -> api_key AND change the condition
       to match the repo's name

   THANKS!

   Note2self: also document how to migrate other env vars from an
   already-integrated repo

   can do that too. Strangely, printenv didn't print properly everything
   for me, looked like the output was cut off from the top, so not all the
   variables were visible. In the end, had to echo every secret variable,
   but suspecting that printenv <variables list> should also do.

   One more thing to mention: replace SSH key with tobiiprotools.
