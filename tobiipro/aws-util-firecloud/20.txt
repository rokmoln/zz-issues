   rather than passing e.g. ctx around, just to able to call
   ctx.log.error, given the lambda's serial execution flow (one event at a
   time), maybe we could do
import {e, ctx, log} from 'aws-util-firecloud/lib/lambda';

log.error(...)

   wdyt [66]@IanSavchenko ?

   I would not do this, looks like not a good pattern to me. And it will
   make it harder to test.
