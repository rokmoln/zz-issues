[63]@andreineculau [64]andreineculau commented [65]Sep 13, 2019

   why?
   because npm deps might come with executables installed in
   ./node_modules/.bin e.g. angular-cli which developers might want to
   access directly, not just via makefiles

   note: a long time ago, this was already the case, but got removed.
   investigate why
   note2: this could be a change for devs only or for devs&ci. investigate
   consequences
