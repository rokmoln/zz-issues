   goal is to have a quick feedback cycle, as opposed to pushing code that
   will trigger a CI agent to spin up, bootstrap itself, fetch
   dependencies, build your code and only then fail with "expected 2
   spaces, not 3"

   it is a pre-push hook, as opposed to a pre-commit because
    1. you should be allowed to commit "wip" code, rewrite history to
       clean it up, etc
    2. make check is fast, but not that fast, so depending on the size of
       the repo, you might be looking at ~1 minute waiting time
       (atex-platform and gs-server have ~40 seconds)

   I ran it with positive outcomes for a couple of weeks myself

   NOTE that the PR in its current form wants to make this the default
   with a opt-out (potentially for repos like atex-platform and
   gs-server). The alternative would be to make it a opt-in, and then have
   each repo add a line to their root Makefiles that includes this inc.mk
   file. The threshold of how much is too much is subjective, but I can
   only guess that it is a good-to-have for most of the repos thus the
   proposition to have it on by default, and off for only those
   "monolithic" repos.

   // [47]@fredrikj [48]@jonashogstrom you were talking of doing the same,
   thus your feedback is appreciated

   Don't know much how it works, but the idea is very good I think. My
   perception is that >50% of builds fail due to linting violation.

   Awesome! I don't understand how this works, though. I see that it
   appends to some "SF_DEPS_TARGETS" which I assume is part of the "deps"
   target? Then I don't understand what the "$@" in the target is. mkdir?
   In the end, this hook need to be put in .git/hooks/pre-push? That path
   is in $@?

   $@ = The file name of the target of the rule. in this case a synonym to

   will it run make check on the local copy of the source? So it might
   fail if I for some reason have WiP code that doesnt pass even though it
   is not committed yet? I guess as long as you are aware of this it
   should be fine. +1 from me.

   👍 good that you bring that up! the answer is both yes and no.

   no because we actually make check looks at "cached" files i.e. files
   that are committed or staged.

   yes because if you stage some lines, but not all, we will check the
   whole file

   my take is that partial staging is not something popular (at least not
   in this circle). but I can add a comment (and maybe even a warning that
   some files are partially staged)
