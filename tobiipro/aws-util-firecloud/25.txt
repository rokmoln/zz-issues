   we had an instance where the lambda logged a response to AWS, but then
   it was waiting for the event loop to become empty, which never
   happened, thus the lambda timed out (and the initial response was
   ignored)

   it would be good to at least log that "hey we are now replying to AWS.
   but this lambda is configured to wait until the event loop is empty,
   and there's smth on the event loop right now" - even better if we can
   report some useful info about what is actually on the event loop

   currently there are only some undocumented nodejs APIs -
   process._getActiveRequests() and process._getActiveHandles() - and even
   those don't work as expected. I tried in a node REPL to run a simple
   async function that sleeps for 10 seconds then console.log-s smth and
   process._getActiveRequests() remained empty, while I was expecting it
   to report the async function somehow.

   tried now also with a setTimeout - still empty array result from
   process._getActiveRequests()

   This worked for me [79]https://github.com/mafintosh/why-is-node-running
let log = require('why-is-node-running');

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('done!');
}, 2000);

log();

   Outputs
There are 1 handle(s) keeping the process running

# Timeout

   üëè I thought async_hooks came in nodejs 10, but i see now it's also in
   nodejs 8

   don't know if it's in the version that aws delivers, but it's worth a
   try

   closing without new functionality in aws-util-firecloud. when a lambda
   times out and needs investigation, one can wrap the lambda and diagnose
   with the help of _.getV8OpenHandles()
