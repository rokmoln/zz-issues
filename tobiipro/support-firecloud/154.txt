     * [65]https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog - does the job, needs
       some new files getting committed into each repo, primary worry is
       that it has some long standing issues, and not many users
     * make unreleased
       [66]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/ba2f2fc/repo
       /mk/core.misc.release.mk#L116-L142 - super simple, no dependencies

   Two other alternatives are got a hell no:
     * [67]https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelo
       g/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-cli - is an npm
       package, both heavy and dynamic, not a good choice for smth
       language agnostic like support-firecloud
     * [68]https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-
       generator - it's a ruby gem, alternatively running inside a docker
       container, but needs a github personal access token, and didn't run
       out of the box
