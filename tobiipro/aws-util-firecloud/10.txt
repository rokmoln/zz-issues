   Q: we said we bump the minor version for our modules when we have
   backward incompat, right?

   I have a vague memory of these talks. I thought we said that we are
   going to stick to classical semantic versioning because nothing is
   stopping us?

   Cool! Maybe you could also split into separate function(s) code under
   if (!partial) { while you are here? :)

   re: versions --- you made me check black-on-white now :) I think we
   started with saying that (what you said), and then we reverted to what
   I said. Reality is like I said though:
    "babel-loader": "^7.1.3",
    "babel-preset-firecloud": "git://github.com/tobiipro/babel-preset-firecloud.
git#semver:~0.1.4",

   re: partial --- üëç
