   Well, that's quite opinionated PR. Even though I agree that it's ok to
   not use const (but see no harm actually using it), I suggest that you
   write here some argumentation for this decision. So when the next team
   member asks me "wait, but why? Every article says you should write
   'const'...", I will be able to direct them here :)

   Also, a tiny unit test may be good? There must be examples here in the
   repo.
