   [67]https://github.com/editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker

   reasons:
     * eclint (npm package) is dead
     * editorconfig-checker works without node (binary produced by go)
     * editorconfig-checker is a wrapper to the actually editorconfig,
       thus all rules/behaviour is consistent
