   Can you elaborate on the use cases for this? When we have tons of
   same/similar logs?

   I think those are two different questions :)

   but the use-case for this is the logger throttling in the extension.
   rather than wrapping the call to the logger, you can create a logger
   with a serializer that will throttle (by returning undefined)
