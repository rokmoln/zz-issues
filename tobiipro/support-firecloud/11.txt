   if travis would have a cronjob to test newer minor/patch versions of
   the dependencies,
   then it could call a make greenkeeper target to do similar stuff like
   greenkeeper.io
     * upgrade deps to the latest minor/patch version (has to support git
       urls)
     * build, run tests

   it could do more (i.e. update deps automatically and git push), but I'm
   interested in the above alone as a first step because that would be
   enough to run the target manually and aid the developer trying to
   upgrade deps. I currently use npm-check-updates but it doesn't support
   git urls
