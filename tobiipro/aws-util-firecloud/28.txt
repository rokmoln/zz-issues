   I would suggest that we pass sqs instance as a named arg together with
   queueName. It can then have a default value of new aws.SQS(), so like
export let getUrl = _.memoize(async function({queueName, sqs = new aws.SQS()}) {
...

   I actually had the thought but i couldn't come up with a reason for it.
   Credentials maybe, now when i think about it.
   Will do it, and i guess it is good to do it for all other funs in
   aws-util-firecloud

   I so your comment about discoverability after i pushed this. I guess
   that can be addressed properly via typescript defs.

   Anything i can do to allure you into writing defs for this repi like
   you did for lodash-firecloud? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤—

   done, except you cannot memoize now (you can, but it makes too complex.
   the caller can take care of it

   I have to say that without memoization, it has not so much benefit
   anymore...

    1. memoization is an optimization, simply cannot be core functionality
    2. one liner vs 10+, useful in generic places sounds like enough
