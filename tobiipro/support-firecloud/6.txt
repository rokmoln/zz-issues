   uncertain but
   [66]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/repo/mk/j
   s.publish.npg.mk#L19 check may not be working with npm 5.7.1 (the
   prepare is not executed e.g. no lib folder of babel-transpiled src
   folder)

   i.e. install a git dep with a "git url + hash" (not a dist tag) as
   version specifier

   smth changed in npm? a bug in npm? a bug with the package-json-prepare
   makefile target?
