   Why did you decide not to have it in support-firecloud?

   The check itself is specific (ENV_NAME is prod).
   The only thing i could do towards having the aws-cli call in one place
   is to define the make function here and let the check happen in each
   .inc.mk file

   Or am i missing smth obvious?!

   No, nothing obvious :)
   But it seems to me like a very repetitive pattern. You could check
   PROD_NS from CONST.inc. For atex-platform it is
   PROD_NS=prod,prod-staging. I guess it's fine to enable termination
   protection for staging too.
