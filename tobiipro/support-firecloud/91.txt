   o-release.md

   in short, if v1.0.0 is on prod, and you want to release a hotfix on top
   of it, run

   make release/v1.0.0-hotfix.0 (actually anything can go after -, but
   <key>.<index> is the semver/npm way

   second hotfix, run

   make release/v1.0.0-hotfix.1

   PS: don't forget to merge the hotfix tag into the master branch. if you
   get a merge conflict with package.json, let the master branch win
