   I guess CYPRESS_baseurl should be all capitals?
   I don't understand what guard-env-WEB_BASE_URL is but I guess it's a
   make target that runs before this and checks that WEB_BASE_URL is
   defined?

   CYPRESS_baseurl isnt part of the make though, its the env variable
   cypress uses to override the default url it runs on.

   guard-env-WEB_BASE_URL is just like you say- it will tell you if the
   variable is undefined so you know why it isnt working üëç

   Yes, I can see that. My remark is just that it has weird casing. Oh, I
   see now that Cypress seems to expect it to look like that:

   It looked a bit broken, and still looks a bit ugly. :)

   Since we can run cypress on the CI both with a deployed env and have it
   spin up its own server, do we need this target?

   Its use is only for when you already have your dev server running, and
   like I said in our mob-prog yesterday, I dont think it makes much sense
   having this target use the same CYPRESS_ARGS too.

   If I was using this in my projects Makefile I would likely define the
   CYPRESS_ARGS for my CI, for instance:
# ...in my projects Makefile

CYPRESS_ARGS = \
    --record true \
    --key dashboard-key \
    --projectId asdasds \


# I probably dont want the same args for my local run of cypress on my dev serve
r

   Either we make another variable for its arguments, or we remove it from
   here and let each project define their own target for running cypress
   locally. It essentially just needs to run cypress run, adding extra
   lists of variables for a single target seems complex

   Thoughts?

   It would be nice if we could support writing our cypress test files in
   TypeScript. Perhaps something for the next mob session?

   I think that in this particular case we could have skipped the
   quotation marks on line 49. But perfectly fine to have them for
   consistency.

   a test target (smth that runs automatically on make test) should have a
   stable behaviour, but now it's dynamic based on the existence of a
   general-purpose variable.
   i think it's fine if the target is "smart" i.e. start a local server if
   one doesn't exist (could use the same wait-on), but it's a different
   thing to run tests against a different server

   i think this goes very much in line with [123]@jobackman's comment

   üëè nice

   there's some cleanup to do imho.

   I would have gone with 2 targets instead of 3
     * test-cypress - which can check if the local server is already
       running (start it of not), run make cypress, and maybe kill local
       server if the target started it
     * cypress - just run cypress --- can be nicely used from bin/test-env
       after deploying, by calling it with
       CYPRESS_baseurl=${WEB_BASE_URL}... make cypress so the generic
       WEB_BASE_URL can disappear from this makefile

   this takes care of Johan's comment, and simplifies quite a lot the
   makefile, and makes the targets more consistent with one other, not the
   least the make $(SF_CYPRESS_TEST_FILES) target
