   it is more extreme with Travis, where we have a limit of 4MB
   stdout/stderr log, but in general we may want to log some files for
   post-analysis of a CI/CD event

   what we need is a small util that given a FOLDER and given a dynamic
   hidden REFERENCE, this util can be added to travis.yml in the
   after_script or after_failure section in order to git add <FOLDER>; git
   commit -m "logs" and git push to the reference (orphan or with the
   CI/CD checkout as parent commit).

   dynamic hidden reference =
     * dynamic: it should support taking the BUILD_ID env var for example,
       or the branch/tag that travis checked out
     * hidden: because it shouldn't be a branch/tag or else it would
       pollute the repo for everyone e.g. refs/logs/${BUILD_ID}

   Looks like some stupid limitation of Travis which requires a dirty hack
   :(
   Maybe it's better to push it to some (semi-public) S3 bucket with guid
   filename? So no one can guess the filename but the link will be printed
   in Travis log.

   no, this is not so tightly related to Travis. Example: it doesn't make
   sense to print out the generated cloudformation templates, but you
   might want to have access to them regardless of the provisioning
   succeeding or failing

   and if you're saying that hidden refs are hacks, they are not. all
   sorts of system use them. even github has the refs/pulls namespace for
   instance

   about s3 - that's what you (read I) immediately think of. "I need to
   store my files somewhere. Where can i find a file/object storage?"
    1. yet the CI/CD already has access to the repo (in many cases RW
       access, not just RO, because you might already need to push tags
       etc), and you already have defined who has access to travis/repo,
    2. while S3 needs extra setup (new tokens to be stored secretly,
       bucket, bucket policies), and also separate permissions in terms of
       who in the team can access the logs (I definitely do not want those
       permissions to be broader than who can access travis or the repo)

   PS: the only thing that I saw as an advantage is that on S3 you can set
   expiry rules. Though that's nothing that can't be done for git refs

   It turns out that TravisCI should actually upload artifacts also on
   failure, just that the docs were out-of-sync. After contacting their
   support, there's a new PR to fix the docs
   [88]travis-ci/docs-travis-ci-com#2219 \o/

   What this means is that we could have
     * travis.yml with artifacts uploading to S3
     * the S3 bucket could have short expiration times where
          + "anyone can write, but only a few authenticated users can
            read"
          + or "anyone can write and read, but only a few authenticated
            users can list" so that if you have access to the travis log,
            you could also click a link in the travis log and read the
            contents of the artifacts, but you wouldn't be able to query
            the S3 bucket and list all of the logs

   What's nice with S3 is the short-expiry IMHO. UI wise it would be nicer
   to browse the logs on github.

   I like the idea with S3 and anyone writing and reading, but nobody
   listing.
