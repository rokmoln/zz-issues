   out of curiousity I just ran the basic benchmarking available at
   [67]https://github.com/pinojs/pino npm run bench-basic
BASIC benchmark averages
Bunyan average: 680.751ms
Winston average: 496.127ms
Bole average: 375.836ms
Debug average: 328.526ms
LogLevel average: 328.303ms
MinLog average: 474.515ms
Pino average: 240.441ms
PinoExtreme average: 103.965ms
PinoNodeStream average: 219.996ms
     __________________________________________________________________

   I identified some red flags, that when/if removed takes minlog to:
BASIC benchmark averages
Bunyan average: 707.045ms
Winston average: 1885.363ms
Bole average: 627.995ms
Debug average: 416.026ms
LogLevel average: 452.593ms
MinLog average: 196.916ms
Pino average: 287.970ms
PinoExtreme average: 131.185ms
PinoNodeStream average: 283.553ms

   red flags:
     * new Date() --- could consider Date.now() -- [68]jsperf
     * getCallerInfo --- could be optional
     * rawEntry --- cloneDeep is expensive, could be optional
