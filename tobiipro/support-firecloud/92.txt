   e.g.
make crypt # init repo with transcrypt or if already done, then encrypt
make crypt/allow # allow someone to decrypt
make crypt/disallow # disallow someone to decrypt
make decrypt # init repo with transcrypt or if already done, then decrypt

   feedback welcome [65]@jobackman

   I like it! How about also including a make encrypt <file>?

   thought about it, but it involves touching the .gitattributes file
   automagically and... that's maybe not a good idea

   now that i think about it, probably the only target that is really
   needed is make decrypt because that's what a few will use a few times.
   but initializing, add a new encrypted file, or flushing the credentials
   will happen close to once a year and then it's better to read the docs
   :)

   Ah, yeah you're probably right, lets skip that then.

   Agreed, this is where the gold lies üè
