   Since node only support import syntax behind a flag and only for .mjs
   file extension, I made a script that uses esm
   [47]https://github.com/standard-things/esm.

   Slightly not performant because it uses npx, and it installs esm every
   time, but with a limited scope, it's good enough.

   Tested manually with an executable like
#!/usr/bin/env node-esm

import _ from 'lodash';
_.forEach([1,2], _.bind(console.log, console));
