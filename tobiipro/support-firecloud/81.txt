   Created a script that creates a github release with assets (binaries).
   This should allow us to reuse the GH_TOKEN env var on travis, and not
   need to encrypt it again for the deploy step.

   Managed to create release "test6" with this
   [48]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/releases/tag/test6
   bin/github-create-release --repo-slug tobiipro/support-firecloud --tag
   test6 --asset NOTICE --asset LICENSE --token ${GH_TOKEN}
