   Didn't look at the rule, too much code. We'll see if how it works in
   life.

   Kind of don't like this practice. Anything smarter we can do? Maybe
   just put these rules in a folder from-eslint or eslint-official?

   we can make a deal to discuss this after 2 more imported rules ;) why
   2? because i somehow think it's not going to happen :) 1 more imported
   rule, maybe maybe maybe, 2 more, never :p

   what would be nice was editorconfig supporting inlined config /*
   editorconfig-disable */

   Well, the imported rule sort-keys was only working on
   ObjectExpressions. I made it work only on ObjectPatterns. Thus a tiny

   The major downside with this rule is that it doesn't come with a fixer.
   The original sort-keys doesn't have one, because people abuse the
   ability to order keys in objects, thus a fixer may mess that up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
