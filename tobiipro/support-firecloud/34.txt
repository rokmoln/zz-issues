   goal: have make node_modules_aws create a node_modules_aws with npm
   dependencies but with native code compiled for the aws lambda
   architecture. This way, a repository/folder could switch out the
   node_modules folder for the contents of node_modules_aws in its make
   dist step, and deliver a distribution artifact that can run on aws
   lambda.

   how: use [65]https://github.com/iopipe/awslambda-npm-install as
   inspiration

   steps:
     * [ ] add docker to bootstrapping procedures
     * [ ] modify the dockerfile in awslambda-npm-install to produce
       instead a node_modules_aws folder
     * [ ] ðŸŽ‰

   docker might not be necessary. use aws codebuild instead - ref
