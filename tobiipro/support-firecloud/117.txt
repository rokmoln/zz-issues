   For example, there was a mistake in Athena query that was creating
   tables in atex-platform. Thus, aws-athena-setup.js script was exiting
   with code 1, but make continued working and returned with exit code 0.
   So the CI build was successful. This does not seem right to me.

   I could reproduce the situation locally.
