   The rule name is arrow-body-style

   I want to be able to do
    labels: _.map(results, (r) => r[`${brand}_brand`]),

   instead of
    labels: _.map(results, (r) => {
      return r[`${brand}_brand`];
    }),

   Kind of like being able to do oneliners like these, it's a feature of
   the new arrow function syntax :)

   It's a "no" from me. Visually it is easier to see args and function
   body when they are on different lines. When you (I mean anyone who
   writes code) know that one-liners are not allowed, you won't be trying
   to squeeze logic into a one-liner and will keep the code readable.
   It can be mentioned here, that usage of fat-arrow functions has to be
   justified by using some other of their qualities (like context
   capturing) not just syntax sugar and less typing (6 characters
   difference?).
