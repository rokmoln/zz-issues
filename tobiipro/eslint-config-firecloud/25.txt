   It is a breaking change, let's release it properly so it does not start
   failing builds.

   The rules become pretty complicated now. Should we write them down
   somewhere?
    1. First of all, import specifiers are ordered by groups in the order
       all, default, named.
    2. In the all and default groups of import statements, they are sorted
       by the import specifier local variable in alphabetical order.
    3. In the case of named group, import statements are sorted by the
       import source.
    4. Inside the curly braces in every named import, they are sorted in
       alphabetical order by the import specifier local variable.
