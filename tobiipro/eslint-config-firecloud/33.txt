   Adds a bit more space between complex statements, so it is easier to
   read code. Tried it out in atex-dashboard and it looked well.

   sure, let's try it out
   i'd suggest though to add also multiline-var and multiline-const (even
   if we don't allow them)

   I take back what I said. I ran this config in atex-platform, and didn't
   like what I saw. One example is that sometimes you do lots of
   transforms to a var and you'd like them grouped.
