   …undle the mixin modules

   this is one way to solve it (I tested manually)

   another way would be to use magic comments like webpackInclude,
   or to make sure to use a template literal in the require calls e.g.
   require(module) would not work, but
   require(\../some/path/${someModule}`)would actually make webpack bundle
   all the files under../some/path/`

   both of the alternatives felt flimsy and webpack specific

   another alternative: remove preval, and go back to how things were
   another alternative: remove preval, just generate lib/mixins/index.js
   via make&bash with explicit require statements
