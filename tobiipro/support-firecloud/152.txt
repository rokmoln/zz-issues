   we currently have means to start a docker container within travis to
   run our pipelines,
   but it is not as easy as "run this make target" in order run a docker
   ci locally (on a dev machine) to get quick feedback.

   // cc [67]@spschlegel (I said I can share some commands, but it is
   simply not as easy as that)
