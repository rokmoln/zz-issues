   We discussed that it should be up to the API lambda itself to setup
   CORS, so need to remove it here, mark the change as breaking and update
   lambdas.

   Regarding reexporting CORS: I wouldn't do it, because clients get to
   decide which version to use and type-inference will probably work
   better (if we decide to use TS in lambda at some point).

   closing. the expressApp (that is accessible in a express-bootstrapped
   lambda handler) now surfaces a property defaultMiddlewares. those
   middlewares can now be manipulated
import cors from 'cors';

import {
  bootstrap
} from 'aws-util-firecloud/lib/express';

export let handle = bootstrap(async function(app, _e, _ctx) {
  app.defaultMiddlewares.cors.disable();
  app.use(cors(...));
});
