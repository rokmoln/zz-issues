   There are certain aspects of VS Code configuration, which I would like
   to have per repo basis and this requires modification of
   .vscode/settings.json, which is tracked by git. So this eventually
   makes SF and a client repo "dirty".

   I suggest that we remove this file to be tracked by git (in client
   repos) and let people configure VS Code as they want.

   This problem could be solved by this feature request
   [65]microsoft/vscode#40233, but it does not look like it is happening.

   There is nothing stopping you from changing the symlink to a regular
   file in each repo that needs thia, as we talked many times... But sure,
   make the change "global" in sf. For consistency though, all tobiipro
   repos should be updated to reflect this change imho. I leave it to you
   if it's worth it.

   PS: maybe the changes you're making to settings.json can actually be
   pushed to sf

   This we discussed, but I want to stop tracking the file and even ignore
   it, so the local changes are not committed.

   I want the font to be pink (almost). I don't think this has to be
   shared.

   I will proceed then with removing the symlink and adding
   .vscode/settings.json to .gitignore.

   I somehow read past your original

   me, personally, I'm couldn't care less (not a hard-core VSCode user,
   and I'll most probably set the same common-sense settings myself
   anyway), EXCEPT
    1. what you're suggesting i.e. "let people configure as they want"
       should be possible today. You can set your font to be pink at a
       user level. We do not configure fonts in a repo's
       .vscode/settings.json but functional stuff.
    2. I think [85]@tobiiasl has a better view in his team, if he thinks
       it's reasonable that every team member when onboarded or when
       setting up a new computer with vscode should go through setting
       stuff like:

     * format on save
     * rules
     * transpiled files to exclude from the tree
     * trim final newlines
     * etc, see
       [86]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/.vsco
       de/settings.json

   PS: having these common-sense vscode settings was to get passed the
   situation where people use vscode as a text editor (without enabling
   certain settings) and thus saving, pushing, linter failed, go back.
   Imho you're barking at this file symlinking, but instead you want to
   bark at vscode's inability to handle your desire :)

   Totally agree with this.

   Ok, there is a difference between a) not having .vscode/settings.json
   in the committed codebase and .gitignoring it or b) having it in the
   codebase, but .gitignoring, so all the local changes are not committed
   by default. I'm all for the second option, this will give reasonable
   defaults to all the team members, but will make it possible to do local
   customizations.

     what you're suggesting i.e. "let people configure as they want"
     should be possible today. You can set your font to be pink at a user
     level. We do not configure fonts in a repo's .vscode/settings.json
     but functional stuff.

   It is possible, but right now it will make the repo "dirty". I'm
   talking now NOT about user settings (which are machine-global), but
   about workspace settings, which are per repo and which we commit. So I
   want the font color to be different based on the repo, but I guess you
   don't want me to commit that.

   I'm making a small PR, we can discuss it there.

     default.

   Once you commit smth, no matter if it's gitignored, you will still have
   it marked as changed, thus risking to be committed. So b is not an
   option as per your goal.

   PS: reading too much johnpapa I see ðŸ˜œ [102]microsoft/vscode#40233
   (comment) . If the setting is somehow not arbitrary (e.g. some colors
   are set based on the repo name Ã¡ la
   [103]http://randomstringtocsscolor.com) and that's how we say we derive
   the color attribute, it can still be checked in.

   In my defense, I came up with the coloring solution and felt this pain
   around December, before John Papa made his plugin ;)

   It seems that there is a way to do this (you can do everything with
   git), but it's so-so, so I can use it myself locally
   [109]https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3319479/can-i-git-commit-a-fil
   e-and-ignore-its-content-changes.

   Ok, let's skip .gitignoring settings.json, but I would still want
   .vscode config files to be not symlinks. Will update PR.

   Ok, even with skip-worktree git complains when I want to switch between
   branches.

   Another way to tackle this would be to .gitignore
   .vscode/settings.json, clean it from all the repos and import "the
   recommended settings from support-firecloud" into VS Code user-settings
   on the machine bootstrap step. Then those reasonable settings will be
   there, repo customizations can be made and they are not committed.

   But it's all not worth it, took too much time, so I'm closing this.
