   General feedback:
     * have one PR per fix; at the very least fix seemingly related things
     * have atomic commits. rewrite history if needed. makes it super
       convenient to git revert --no-commit <bad_commit>
     * I used the opportunity of this PR, to raise a few benign issues,
       related to "this is how we do it", just FYI
     * when it comes to coding style, we talked about things IRL, but I've
       created an issue to document it for the sake of everyone else
       [61]#146

   On the main topic of "no sudo", I left a comment inline around what
   defines the behaviour of "no sudo" - should it shortcircuit? should it
   prompt the user to take action manually?
   This PR shortcircuits once with exit 0 in ci/linux/bootstrap-sudo,
   while another time it uses exit 1 in sh/core.inc.sh , which raised my
   eyebrows around the goal.

   I wrote inline that some code that I wrote was in vitro, and might be
   junk. But if it isn't junk and it fulfills your goal of "please don't
   run sudo behind my back", then we can close this PR without merging.

   lots of assumptions here:
     * that a user can not have older bash than v3
     * that the homebrew bash is v5

   you can look in the travis output, and in bin/ci-echo for the
   implementation and behaviour of echo_do and echo_done but in short we
   create log groups that travis and other CIs fold automatically

   so if you use a echo_do, use a echo_done as well, otherwise the
   folding, the automatic timing of a coding block, etc gets off

   If I understand correctly, you wanted the "no sudo" version because for
   various reasons one might not have sudo installed, or one might not
   want to make it available to scripts (by passing a configuration
   flag/variable).

   If that's the case, it should be possible to have a consistent
   behaviour of prompting the user "yo, i can't run sudo on this command,
   please run it yourself" and waiting for confirmation. Or am i wrong?

   This is what I ended up trying in [87]6ffa60d

   I coded in vitro that commit, so now I need to test it.

   Your choice to shortcircuit means that you consider everything else
   unnecessary (and it might be that some things are related to CI
   environments in general, or to Travis in specific), but it might not be
   so with the existing commands or future commands that will get added.
   So the current PR doesn't just handle the case of "no sudo", but also
   introduces new execution branches.

   There are many alternatives, but some more thought would be needed to
   pick one.

   PS: also, if you just exit 0, it means that the instructions are lost

   this is not going to work I'm afraid
   as we run "bash strict mode", meaning this
   [98]http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/ except
   we leave IFS alone

   so if sudo true fails, it will just shortcircuit the entire script

   which is why you see this pattern of
this || that

   which at times evolves into
this || {
  that
  and_that
}

   and at times evolves into the less unreadable version ðŸ™ˆ (which ofc
   could be rewritten to an if)
!this || !this_either || {
  that

   for these small and benign changes, a separate PR that just flushes out
   one style for another is preferred to keep the history clean
