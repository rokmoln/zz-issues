   What does value is T mean? I would expect Boolean here.

   as per my (limited) understanding:
     * T is a generic
     * you return true (not just Boolean) if value is T and thus not value
       is undefined

   original isUndefined for instance is defined similarly

   I count 15 occurrences of !_.isUndefined in our OSS repos, and they are
   all error-prone due to 1. !_. and 2. the apparent double negation (it
   is not, since undefined is a "type", but it reads as "if not not
   defined")
