   [67]@IanSavchenko do you see another=simpler way of achieving this

   6420778fa3b85d31/.eslintrc.js#L95-L117 ?
   with lodash built-ins ? it's a defaultsDeep down to 1-level only

   otherwise I intend to move that in here. at least temporarily, that
   function will need to be used in all (currently 3) repos where we use
   typescript, because a lack of functionality in eslint's overrides

   It seems to be correct, but I wouldn't move it here. Looks very
   specific to this use case and the naming does not say much
   (defaultsDeep down to 1-level only is a much better description than
   defaultsValues).

   Maybe SF?

   Btw, in this line, the right-hand side mutates the first objsKey (which
   I would call objsValue, probably). Don't know if it's a problem, but
   still...
      acc[key] = _.defaults(...objsKey);

   since it's related to eslint, it could actually be moved to
   eslint-config-firecloud
