   I'm thinking that this may be a bit too strict requirement. Also, if
   you have to rebase on every push into PR, it will outdate PR comments
   even for things that didn't really change (because commits' hash will
   change). Also, you will have to force-push in this situation, which has
   some danger.

   Also, I like that now we can easily revert merge, so I want merge
   commits to stay. But that's not a question, right?

   So how I see it: you should be able to work on your PR, get relevant
   Travis status (that it works for the given PR branch and not if the
   branch is up-to-date) and only before merge you need to make sure that
   it will work with current master.

   It seems like this is actually doing what we want:
   [62]https://help.github.com/articles/enabling-required-status-checks/.
   See point 5.

   Also, it seems like a fail of after_success on Travis will not trigger
   build to be failed, btw. See
   [63]https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle#breaking-the-build

   No, that will still be doable. A merge commit will still be created.
   It's not about a fast-forward merge.

     /. See point 5.

   Why the f did I not see that??? Yes! that's the one! Because I did look
   for it. Both in their docs and random googling.
