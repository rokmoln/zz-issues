   Fixes [46]#4

   once the babel target moves to nodejs 8.x.x (where async/await syntax
   is available),
   bluebird can be removed altogether

   [54]@IanSavchenko github protip (which i discovered yesterday) - an
   issue can be closed also via keywords in the PR description, not just
   in the commit message. This is useful because by default the owner of a
   repo can edit other people's PRs and just add these keywords.
