     __________________________________________________________________

   log functions are currently async, but in certain situations these
   functions cannot be awaited e.g. you can only do it inside an async
   function

   in order to normalize the situation, the logging functions are made
   sync and they actually become queue pushers.

   a secondary method is introduced to flush the queue to serializers and
   listeners. wherever needed, the parent code can await minlog.flush();
   at t0 if it wants to make sure that log entries reached pushed before
   t0 reached all listeners

   Nice solution. This looks totally weird at first. Is this a common
   pattern?
