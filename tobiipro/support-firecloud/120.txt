   We were adding some svg files to the image assets when we noted that
   our editorconfig will stop pushes because the svg files exceed the
   allowed line-length.

   I would assume images should be excluded from being linted by
   editorconfig.

   I would suggest excluding svg files from the editorconfig either
   entirely, or at least by this rule:
[*.svg]
max_line_length = none

   Thoughts?

   replying inline to separate concerns

     I would assume images should be excluded from being linted by
     editorconfig.

   editorconfig per se doesn't distinguish between binary and text files,
   so it's true that we could add definitions like
[*.{gif,png,jpg,jpeg,zip,etc,etc,etc}]
insert_final_newline = none
max_line_length = none
etc = none

   on the other hand, the tool that we use to lint files based on the
   editorconfig configuration excludes binary files starting with version
   2.0.0 [74]https://github.com/jedmao/eclint/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

   so it is a bit redundant in that sense

     I would suggest excluding svg files from the editorconfig either
     entirely, or at least by this rule:

   SVG files are not binary, they are just XML, like HTML files are. I
   don't see why they should be special and ignored by editorconfig.

   Since you're not writing these SVGs by hand, and just importing them as
   assets, I suggest adding the src/assets (or similar) path to the
   SF_VENDOR_FILES_IGNORE variable in Makefile.

   Ahaa! Didnt know about SF_VENDOR_FILES_IGNORE. It looks like it solved
   our issues, so I'll close this!

   Thanks üôè
