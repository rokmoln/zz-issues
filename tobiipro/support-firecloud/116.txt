   What's the idea behind this line?

   it's a way to check if package-lock.json is checked in
   we generally do not check it in (due to the .npmrc and .gitignore
   config), but there's nothing stopping someone from doing so

   thing is that npm audit can only be run if there is a
   package-lock.json. the longer story is that it is actually run
   automatically by npm install (but it doesn't exit with a non-zero code)

   so what we need to do is first create a package-lock.json, if one isn't
   checked-in
   then we run npm audit and maybe npm audit --fix
   and then we maybe clean up the intermediary package-lock.json artifact

   Do we need to exit with error here? As I understand it, if npm audit
   fix succeeds, we should happily continue, right? Or no?

   it is actually the same pattern as we use for the linters, see
   [97]https://github.com/tobiipro/support-firecloud/blob/master/repo/mk/j
   s.check.eslint.mk#L28-L30

   it fails, because at least the CI should fail on this one, as the audit
   fixes should be checked in.

   there are 3 situations to handle with npm audit failing, all requiring
   a commit:
    1. package-lock.json is checked-in, then after npm audit fix would
       modify it and maybe package.json too, and you should check them in
    2. package-lock.json is NOT checked-in, npm audit fix might modify
       package.json, and you should check it in
    3. package-lock.json is NOT checked-in, npm audit fix cannot fix the
       security by upgrading some top-level dependency in package.json,
       and basically you have 2 options, either don't run deps-npm-audit,
       or commit a package-lock.json (smth which I don't mention on
       purpose because). If you don't do any of these 2 things, then there
       is no way to get passed this check.

   I agree with these points. More worried about CI and development
   experience on branches. It can be so that a feature branch is suddenly
   starting to fail without no apparent reason and then it has to include
   changes that are not related to the feature.
   My suggestion is to run audit only on master. So we have such cases:
    1. Master - has audits, runs on cron and fails early, always gets
       fixed ASAP by someone from the team.
    2. Feature branches - don't run audit, it will be run on master after
       merge.
    3. Provision branches (env/X) - don't run the audit, install whatever
       dependencies specified in a given tag. We make deploy more
       reliable.

   WDYT?

     It can be so that a feature branch is suddenly starting to fail
     without no apparent reason and then it has to include changes that
     are not related to the feature.

   That is the case for plenty of other things. That is not to say that +1
   doesn't matter, but that it's a risk that is taken as a development
   feature - fail early.

     My suggestion is to run audit only on master.

   There a few issues with that.
   First - a practicality. The Makefiles in support-firecloud should not
   have such exceptions, so that leaves having an if in each project's
   Makefile to filter-out (or if we decide this is an opt-in target, add)
   the deps-npm-audit target.
   Secondly - it opens the door for surprises after merging the PR. You
   add packages for your feature, get the PR accepted, and then master
   fails. The purpose of PRs is to keep master as clean as possible for a
   variety of reasons, but we've just hijacked that feature now. And on
   top of it, maybe it is not possible to make a fix so that npm audit is
   green, maybe you need to exchange a whole package with another, etc,
   etc maybe it takes time, so you need to revert your PR merge, etc

     Provision branches (env/X) - don't run the audit, install whatever
     dependencies specified in a given tag. We make deploy more reliable.

   I don't think we run this there. We take the snapshots. Or?

     That is the case for plenty of other things.

   And all of them are annoying and disruptive when you have to figure out
   why the hell your branch starts to fail because someone pushed some
   release in a dependency :) I wouldn't want there to be one more.

     First - a practicality. The Makefiles in support-firecloud should
     not have such exceptions, so that leaves having an if in each
     project's Makefile to filter-out (or if we decide this is an opt-in
     target, add) the deps-npm-audit target.

   Another way: put it in the ci script and create a top level target make
   audit that will be run only on master. There is a number of ways to do
   it and you know it much better.

     Secondly - it opens the door for surprises after merging the PR. You
     add packages for your feature, get the PR accepted, and then master
     fails. The purpose of PRs is to keep master as clean as possible for
     a variety of reasons, but we've just hijacked that feature now. And
     on top of it, maybe it is not possible to make a fix so that npm
     audit is green, maybe you need to exchange a whole package with
     another, etc, etc maybe it takes time, so you need to revert your PR
     merge, etc

   That's not such a surprise, actually, since Github runs PR checks
   against a potential merge commit with the master, so we will fail
   before the actual merge. Another option: to do the audit on make deps
   as we do now without failure. I pay attention to those warnings and
   would be even more attentive if I knew that it will break master after
   merging in my branch.

     I don't think we run this there. We take the snapshots. Or?

   You are probably right 👍

   made a discovery: apparently you cannot audit a "private" package i.e.
   if package.json has private: true (which was supposed to be a good way
   to stop someone from erroneously publishing the package to an npm
   registry...)

   might be a BLOCKER to move forward on this, and might need to back down
   to having this audit as optional

   pausing the effort:
    1. private field should be removed
    2. need to consider a better way of ignoring advisories e.g.
