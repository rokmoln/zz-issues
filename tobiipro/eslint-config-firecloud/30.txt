   without this, I got
export let makeLocalHandler = function({lambda: {mainFun, awsFunctionName}}) {

   "fixed" into
export let makeLocalHandler = function({
  lambda: {
    mainFun, awsFunctionName
  }
}) {

   LGTM, though arrays spanned across several lines look weird. I would
   allow up to 2 elements in array to be on the same line. Or maybe at
   least 1.

   then we're not consistent imo. why allow 1 or 2 array elements, but not
   1 or 2 object properties?

   I'm merging since the comment it's not tied to this particular PR
   (targeting objects), and we can see later how we want to address this,
   ok?
