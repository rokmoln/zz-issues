   after [47]#66
   trying to change a page via the Github UI, will actually create a new
   branch
   named - e.g. master-1 and then travis will start building

   we also know that the f/ prefix is not followed by everyone,
   so this is slightly more liberal for humans, while still restrictive
   for the travis machines
     __________________________________________________________________

   the pattern suits gs-client, and we can make the other repos with
   "environments" to follow the pattern of "-master" if you want an
   environment, so that we don't have "-env" anymore. just a thought

    1. Approving removing f/ prefix üëç
    2. insisting on keeping -env suffix ‚úãReason: it's more clear (was very
       confusing for me the first time I saw this multi-master setup we
       had earlier) and shorter (so you can get longer safe env names in
       AWS, remembering S3 bucket name length limit).

   so you're saying "to each their own" üëç - I removed the regex *-master
